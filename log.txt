DEBUG:SCRIPT: GAME: Prologue Say:	The Japanese had arrived: A brutal herd from across the Shum Chun River.
DEBUG:SCRIPT: GAME: Prologue Say:	They took our formidable bunkers and mighty batteries.
DEBUG:SCRIPT: GAME: Prologue Say:	We had a heroic fortnight, but now it's over.
DEBUG:SCRIPT: GAME: Prologue Say:	They killed our men and raped our women.
DEBUG:SCRIPT: GAME: Prologue Say:	Many were jailed in concentration camps.
DEBUG:SCRIPT: GAME: Prologue Say:	They deported people and took our money away.
DEBUG:SCRIPT: GAME: Prologue Say:	Tyranny skyrocketed. Hong Kong was ruined.
DEBUG:SCRIPT: GAME: Prologue Say:	People hoped to remove the fascist occupants from Hong Kong, or at least prevent them from living comfortably.
DEBUG:SCRIPT: GAME: Prologue Say:	That was no easy task.
DEBUG:SCRIPT: GAME: Prologue Say:	They had no Killer Machines.
DEBUG:SCRIPT: GAME: Prologue Say:	They could not wipe out the thousands of fascists overnight. They lacked weapons and personnel to revolt, even food began to run short.
DEBUG:SCRIPT: GAME: Prologue Say:	Hope dwindled as tyranny intensified.
DEBUG:SCRIPT: GAME: Prologue Say:	Maybe there were secret projects underway to do so anyway.
DEBUG:SCRIPT: GAME: Prologue Say:	Covert operations to liberate the citizens from the tyranny!
